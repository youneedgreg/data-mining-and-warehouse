# Star Schema Design Explanation

I chose a star schema over snowflake because:
1. **Simpler queries** - Fewer joins required for analysis
2. **Better performance** - Denormalized structure optimizes query speed
3. **Easier maintenance** - Less complex relationships to manage

The star schema effectively supports our retail analytics requirements.
